# fileCompressor
Used sharp as a module for Nodejs to convert images of different formats and dimensions to a smaller size without compromising the quality of the picture

I used multer as a middleware for handling form data that is mainly used to upload files, by combining it with express.js I was able to easily implement the file upload feature.

- Currently it's hosted in localhost only
